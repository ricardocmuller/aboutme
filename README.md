Hi there! My name is Ricardo, I am originally from Brazil and in 2009 migrated to Perth, Western Australia 🦘

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a former architectural designer and University tutor who developed data and programming skills over the few last years, becoming a certified data scientist, and building a portfolio of projects that I am now sharing on GitHub.

Passionate about learning and teaching, I am always looking to make a positive impact through the application and dissemination of knowledge.

I believe that the lateral thinking from architecture coupled with the technical skills of data science and data analysis create a unique skillset to tackle business and world problems.

## 🔎 Projects

My portfolio of personal projects are pinned below for viewing, each with a dedicated repo, and showcase the use of technologies such as __Python__, __Power BI__, and __SQL__ working with different datasets to solve problems and answer questions.

Additionally, a separate repo includes some of the projects completed as part of the coursework and certification process at DataCamp.
