Hi there! My name is Ricardo, I am originally from Brazil and in 2009 migrated to Perth, Western Australia 🦘

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a former architectural designer and University tutor who developed data and programming skills over the few last years, becoming a certified data scientist, and building a portfolio of projects that I am now sharing on GitHub.

I believe that the lateral thinking from architecture coupled with the technical skills of data science and data analysis create a unique skillset to tackle business and world problems.
