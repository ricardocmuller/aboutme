Hi there, my name is Ricardo, I am originally from Brazil and in 2009 migrated to Perth, Western Australia ðŸ¦˜

I am a former architectural designer and University tutor who developed data skills over the last years, becoming a certified data scientist, and building a portfolio of projects that I share here on GitHub.

I believe that the lateral thinking from architecture coupled with the technical skills of data science and data analysis create a unique skillset to tackle business and world problems.
